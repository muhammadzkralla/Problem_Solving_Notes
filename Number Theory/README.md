Iterating over b array until finding the first decreasing sequence and either remove the equivalent index in a array, the one before, or the one after. Then see if the b array is sorted or not. <br>

[1979B XOR Sequences](https://codeforces.com/contest/1979/problem/B "1979B XOR Sequences") <br>
Convert each of x, and y to their binary representation and you will observe that the answer is always 2 to the power of the length of matching bits from x and y starting from the LSB until the first difference occures. <br>
