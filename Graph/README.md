`Dijkstra.cpp` is the solution to the Trading for a piano problem on chapter 7 in Grokking Algorithms book. <br>

[20C Dijkstra_](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/20/C "20C Dijkstra_") <br>
Standard Dijkstra implementation but take care that maybe there won't be a valid path from start to target. <br>

[938D Buy a Ticket](https://codeforces.com/contest/938/problem/D "938D Buy a Ticket") <br>
Standard Dijkstra implementation but take care that there's an initial cost for each node so, we add them initially and since we know the current cost of each node, we will add all the nodes to the processing set to calculate the smallest cost for its neighabours.<br>
