[1986D Mathematical Problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1986/problem/D "1986D Mathematical Problem") <br>
n - 2 operations means that there will be only one pair of digits treated as one number, so we brute force and try each pair of numbers as the constraints are low and minimize the answer. If there's a zero digit, then the answer is zero as we can multiply it by the rest of the digits. All ones are ignored as the best solution for them is to multiply by them, otherwize the best decision is to add the digit. <br>

[397. Integer Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-replacement/description/ "397. Integer Replacement") <br>
Let's agree that if the number is even, the optimal process to do is to divide it by two as this would make it go down to 1 faster. Ok what if the number is odd? You should decide whether to decrement or increment the number by one, when to do what? Either choices will make the number even, however, if incrementing the number results in a multiple of 4, it is guaranteed that this number can be divided by two more than once, which results in less number of operations except for the number 3 which is an edge case. Otherwise, decrement the number.<br>

[334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/description/ "334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence") <br>
We will create two variables to store the minimum number we passed by and the other to see if we passed by a number that is greater than the first minimum number but less than the current number. If the current number we are at, is greater than both of the two variables before, we have the triplet. More formally, `mn` will hold the minimum number we have found yet, `mx` will hold the number that's greater than `mn` but less than current `mx`, if the current number we are processing is greater than both `mn` and `mx`, it's the third number in the triplet.<br>

`0-minoperations.py` is the solution to the third interview question in ALX SWE. We have three variables, `count` the number of current 'H's in the string, `operations` the number of applied operations, `clipboard` the number of current 'H's we can paste right now. While `count` is less than the required number `n`, each time we need to choose the optimal move, which is: If the `n` is a multiple of `count` paste, otherwise, we copy and paste until `n` becomes a multiple of `count` <br>

[1992D Test of Love](https://codeforces.com/contest/1992/problem/D "1992D Test of Love") <br>
We always try to reach the nearest possible log. We keep moving forward and if the current cell is a log, then we can move more `m - 1` cells forward. If it's a water cell and we can not move any cells forward, then we must step on it and count it as we cannot step on water for more than `k` times. If it's not a log or a water cell and w can not move any cells forward, then we can not reach the end without stepping on a crocodile.  <br>
