[1986D Mathematical Problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1986/problem/D "1986D Mathematical Problem") <br>
n - 2 operations means that there will be only one pair of digits treated as one number, so we brute force and try each pair of numbers as the constraints are low and minimize the answer. If there's a zero digit, then the answer is zero as we can multiply it by the rest of the digits. All ones are ignored as the best solution for them is to multiply by them, otherwize the best decision is to add the digit. <br>

Let's agree that if the number is even, the optimal process to do is to divide it by two as this would make it go down to 1 faster. Ok what if the number is odd? You should decide whether to decrement or increment the number by one, when to do what? Either choices will make the number even, however, if incrementing the number results in a multiple of 4, it is guaranteed that this number can be divided by two more than once, which results in less number of operations except for the number 3 which is an edge case. Otherwise, decrement the number<br>
