[1934. Confirmation Rate](https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/ "1934. Confirmation Rate") <br>
`t1` CTE represents each `user_id` with their total count of 'confirmed' records. `t2` CTE represents each `user_id` and their total count of occurences in the database. `t3` CTE represents each `user_id` and their `confirmation_rate` but it does not contain all the `user_id`s in the `signup` table, so we need to join it with the `signup` table with left join and use `coalesce` to replace null values with zero.<br>

[1251. Average Selling Price](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/ "1251. Average Selling Price") <br>
`t1` CTE represents each `product` with their total count of `items_sold`, this helps us know how many items are sold of each item to use it later to calculate the average price of this item. `t2` CTE represents each `product` with their total amount of money spent on this item according to when was this item sold and its price on that date, the problem with this CTE is that it does not give us the total price for each item in just one row, so we need another CTE `t3`. `t3` CTE represents each `product` and the total amount of money spent on it over all time. `t4` CTE represents each `product` with their average price, `average_price`, but it does not contain all the `product_id`s in the `prices` table, so we need to join it with the `prices` table with left join and use `coalesce` to replace null values with zero. <br>
