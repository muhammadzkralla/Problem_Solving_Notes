[2582. Pass the Pillow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pass-the-pillow/description/ "2582. Pass the Pillow") <br>
The time required for each round to be done is n - 1 so, we can calculate the total number of rounds, that will be equal to `number of rounds = time / (n - 1)`, this gives us the number of completed rounds either from 1 -> n or from n -> 1, however, we might complete moving after a round is done, either from left to the right or vice versa so, we calculate the remaining moves after all the rounds are done which will be equal to `remaining moves = time % (n - 1)`. If the number of rounds is even, then we moved from 1 -> n and then moved from n -> 1 and stopped, meaning that the remaining moves will be from 1 towards n. If the number of rounds is odd, then we moved from 1 -> n and stopped, meaning that the remaining moves will be from n towards 1.<br>

Initialize a variable `ans` with 0, keep shifting it one unit to the left each time, add the right-most digit in `x`, divide `x` by 10 to remove the right-most digit.<br>

We can brute force on a as long as it keeps the conditions satisfied, and then brute force again on b, however, we can not do a regular brute force on b as it will get TLE so, we will only try the numbers that makes the term `ab` less than or equal n AND the term `a + b` less than or equal n so, we will try all the numbers from `1 -> n / a`. Now we have a and b, we need to calculate c, well to do so we will take c as a common factor from both conditions to see that for a known value of a and b, c can be less than or equal `(n - (a * b)) / (a + b)` or less than or equal `x - a - b`, we check if the two conditions are valid with each value and if so, add all the numbers of c from 1 unitl this chosen c. <br>
