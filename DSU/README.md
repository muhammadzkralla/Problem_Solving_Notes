[3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-walk-in-weighted-graph/description/ "3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph") <br>
Since we want to get the minimum cost of a walk from a node `u` to a node `v`, and `BITWISE AND`ing always results in a value less than both ends, meaning that `a & b <= min(a, b)`, and `a & a = a`, then for any path, we need to take all the available edges from the starting node to the ending node at least once. This observation can lead us to creating a DSU to track each connected components together and an array `cost` to store the cumulative `BITWISE AND`ing of all these connected components. <br>
